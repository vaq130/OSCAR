summary: Implement regular patches and updates
description: |
  Regular patches and updates are necessary to improve the security, performance, and reliability of software and systems. 
  They include bug fixes, security updates, and performance improvements. 
  Regular patches and updates also ensure compatibility with new technologies and can help maintain compliance with regulatory standards. 
  Failure to install patches and updates can leave systems vulnerable to security threats, cause system failures or crashes, and limit the functionality of software and systems.
