summary: Enable data encryption at rest
description: |
    Encryption at rest is essential for preventing data breaches, complying with data privacy regulations, and protecting sensitive data. 
    Organizations must identify which data needs encryption, select appropriate encryption algorithms and key management strategies, and regularly audit and assess their encryption at rest implementation.
    Check your cloud provider documentation for more details on how to enable data encryption at rest.
