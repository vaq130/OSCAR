summary: Restrict the ability to delete repositories
description: |
  Restricting the ability to delete repositories protects the organization from intentional and unintentional data loss. 
  This ensures that users cannot delete repositories or cause other potential damage — whether by accident or due to their account being hacked — unless they have the correct privileges.
  Enforce repository deletion by a few trusted and responsible users only.
