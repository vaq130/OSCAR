summary: Isolate pipeline for unreviewed code
description: |
  Ensure that pipelines running unreviewed code are executed on isolated nodes, not exposed to secrets and sensitive environments.
  For sensitive pipelines, for example those that are exposed to secrets, ensure that each branch that is configured to trigger a pipeline in the CI system has a correlating branch protection rule in the SCM.
  Each pipeline should only have access to the credentials it needs to fulfill its purpose. The credentials should have the minimum required privileges.
