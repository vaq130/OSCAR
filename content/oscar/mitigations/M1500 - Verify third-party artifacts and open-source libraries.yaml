summary: Verify third-party artifacts and open-source libraries
description: |
  Verify third-party artifacts used in code are trusted and have not been infected by a malicious actor before use. 
  This can be accomplished, for example, by comparing the checksum of the dependency to its checksum in a trusted source. 
  If a difference arises, this may be a sign that someone interfered and added malicious code. 
  If this dependency is used, it will infect the environment and could end in a massive breach, leaving the organization exposed to data leaks and more.
