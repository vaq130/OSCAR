summary: Validate dependencies
description: |
  Validate every dependency of the pipeline before use.
  To ensure that a dependency used in a pipeline is trusted and has not been infected by a malicious actor (e.g., the Codecov incident), validate dependencies before using them. 
  This can be accomplished by comparing the checksum of the dependency to its checksum in a trusted source. 
  If a difference arises, this is a sign that an unknown actor has interfered and may have added malevolent code. 
  If this dependency is used, it will infect the environment, which could end in a massive breach and leave the organization exposed to data leaks, etc.
