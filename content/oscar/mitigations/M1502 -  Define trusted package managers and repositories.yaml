summary: Define trusted package managers and repositories
description: |
  When pulling a package by name, the package manager might look for it in several package registries, some of which may be untrusted or badly configured. 
  If the package is pulled from such a registry, there is a higher likelihood that it could prove malicious. 
  In order to avoid this, configure packages to be pulled from trusted package registries.
