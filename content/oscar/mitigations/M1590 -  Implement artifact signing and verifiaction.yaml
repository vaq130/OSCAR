summary: Implement artifact signing and verification
description: |
  Implementing artifact signing and verification can help prevent malicious actors from injecting or modifying software components with malicious code in the software supply chain. 
  Only components that are signed and verified are allowed to proceed to the next stage of the CI/CD process, ensuring that only trusted components are used in the development and delivery of software applications.
