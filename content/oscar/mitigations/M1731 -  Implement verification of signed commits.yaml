summary: Implement verification of signed commits
description: |
  Signing commits, or requiring to sign commits, gives other users confidence about the origin of a specific code change. 
  It ensures that the author of the change is not hidden and is verified by the version control system, thus the change comes from a trusted source.
  For each repository in use, enforce the branch protection rule of requiring signed commits, and make sure only signed commits are capable of merging.
