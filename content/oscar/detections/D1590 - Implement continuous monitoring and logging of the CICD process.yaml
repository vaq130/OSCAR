summary: Implement continuous monitoring and logging of the CI/CD process
description: |
  Continuous monitoring and logging of the CI/CD process can help organizations detect any unusual activities or deviations from the standard workflow. 
  This can include monitoring the pipeline for unusual resource requests or unauthorized access attempts, as well as analyzing logs for unusual activity that may indicate a potential security breach. 
  By establishing a baseline of normal behavior and regularly comparing it to current activity, organizations can quickly identify and respond to any anomalous behavior. 
  Implementing automated alerts and notifications for suspicious activity can also help security teams respond promptly to potential threats.
