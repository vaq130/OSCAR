summary: Implement Intrusion Detection System and anti-malware
description: |
  An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a security tool designed to detect and alert on unauthorized access to a computer system or network.
  Implementing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and anti-malware software can help to identify and block malicious activity.
  IDS is a critical security tool that helps organizations to detect and respond to security incidents in a timely manner. 
  By providing real-time monitoring and analysis of network traffic, IDS can help organizations to stay ahead of potential threats and reduce the risk of a security breach.
