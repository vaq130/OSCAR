summary: Inject malicious dependency to privileged user repository 

description: |
  Injecting a malicious dependency into a privileged user repository is a software supply chain attack where an attacker adds malicious code to a legitimate open-source library or package used as a dependency by a privileged user repository. 
  By doing so, they can gain access to the privileged resources or data associated with the repository and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
