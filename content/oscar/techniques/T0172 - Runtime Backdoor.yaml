summary: Runtime Backdoor

description: |
  A runtime backdoor attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker gains unauthorized access to a computer system or network and installs a malicious software or code that allows them to control the system or steal sensitive information.
  This type of attack is called a "runtime" backdoor attack because it involves manipulating the system at runtime, while it is running, rather than during the development or deployment stages.
  The attacker typically gains access to the system through a vulnerability, such as an unpatched software flaw or weak authentication mechanism. 
  Once inside, the attacker can install a backdoor that provides them with persistent access to the system, even after the initial entry point has been closed.
