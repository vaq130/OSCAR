summary: Delete repositories for DoS

description: |
  A delete repository attack technique in a CI/CD pipeline is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that targets the code repositories used by the pipeline. 
  The goal of the attack is to delete the repositories or make them unavailable, thus disrupting the pipeline's ability to build and deploy software.
  In a typical CI/CD pipeline, code repositories are an essential component as they contain the source code for the application that is being built and deployed. 
  In a delete repository attack, an attacker gains unauthorized access to the repositories and deletes the source code. 
  This can cause significant disruptions to the pipeline, leading to delays in software releases or even complete downtime of the system.
