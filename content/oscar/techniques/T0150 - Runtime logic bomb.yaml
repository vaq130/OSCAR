summary: Runtime logic bomb

description: |
  A logic bomb is a snippet of malicious code that is intentionally inserted into other software. 
  Logic bombs are triggered when a certain condition is met.
  The code may lie dormant for a long time and remain undetected until the bomb is triggered.
  When the bomb is activated, it can have devastating effects on the software, causing it to malfunction, delete data, or even grant unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  The attack can also be designed to spread to other systems or cause damage to a wider network.
  The malicious code is hidden within an otherwise legitimate software package.
  It can be introduced at any point in the software supply chain.
