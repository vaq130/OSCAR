description: |
  A package installation script injection attack is a type of security exploit that involves an attacker injecting malicious code into a legitimate software package installation script.
  The attack typically occurs when an attacker gains access to the distribution network of a software vendor or package manager, and injects malicious code into the package installation script. 
  This code may be designed to carry out a range of nefarious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, creating backdoors, or executing arbitrary code on the victim's system.
  Once the victim downloads and installs the compromised software package, the injected code is executed, giving the attacker access to the victim's system.
