summary: Runners agents running with high user privileges

description: |
   A container/runner agent privilege escalation attack is a security threat where an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in a container/runner agent to gain elevated privileges or access to sensitive resources they are not authorized to have. 
   Attackers may exploit software vulnerabilities or weaknesses in container security controls to gain access to privileged resources, execute arbitrary code, or escape the container/runner agent and gain access to the host system.
