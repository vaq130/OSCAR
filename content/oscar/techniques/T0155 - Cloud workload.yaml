summary: Cloud workload

description: |
  Adversaries can exploit serverless computing, integration, and automation services in cloud environments to execute arbitrary code. 
  This can be done through serverless functions, compute engines, application integration, and web servers. 
  The attackers can use these resources to run malicious code, such as crypto-mining malware or create functions that enable further compromise of the cloud environment. 
  Attackers may also use event-triggered execution to persistently execute serverless functions over time, such as creating Lambda functions in AWS environments that add additional cloud credentials to a user.
