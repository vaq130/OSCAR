summary: Auto merge rules in SCM

description: |
  Auto merge rules in SCM (Source Code Management) are rules that determine how code changes should be merged automatically into a main code repository or branch.
  While auto merge rules in SCM can help to streamline the code review and merge process, there are several security risks to consider, including:
  1. Malicious code injection: Auto merge rules may allow malicious code changes to be merged into the code repository, compromising the security of the system.
  2. Vulnerability propagation: Automatic merges can propagate security vulnerabilities to the main code repository or branch, allowing attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the system.
  3. Human error: Auto merge rules can lead to errors in the code repository, such as overwriting critical code or merging code that has not been properly reviewed.
  4. Compliance violations: Auto merge rules can violate compliance requirements, such as failing to properly audit code changes or not properly segregating code changes between different teams.
