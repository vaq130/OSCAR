summary: Resource hijacking

description: |
  Resource hijacking is a significant threat to cloud and container security. 
  It refers to the unauthorized use of computing resources, such as CPU power, memory, and bandwidth, by an attacker who has gained control over a system or network.
  In cloud environments, attackers can compromise cloud-based systems to perform resource-intensive tasks like cryptocurrency mining, DDoS attacks, and other malicious activities. 
  This can significantly impact system availability and negatively affect hosted services. 
  Attackers can also leverage cloud-based resources to launch attacks on other targets, amplifying the impact of their actions.
  Similarly, in containerized environments, attackers can use compromised containers to launch resource-hijacking attacks. 
  By deploying multiple containers within a cluster or environment, attackers can scale their mining activities and launch coordinated DDoS attacks.
