summary: Push implants across repositories 

description: |
  The Push Implants across Repositories attack technique is a type of lateral movement tactic where an attacker gains access to a victim's code repository, modifies the code by implanting malicious code or backdoors, and pushes the modified code back to the repository.
  This technique often involves the attacker stealing valid credentials, such as login credentials or SSH keys, to gain access to the victim's code repository. 
  They then modify the code, implanting the malicious code or backdoors, and push the modified code back to the repository. 
  The victim then unknowingly deploys the modified code, resulting in the compromise of their systems.
