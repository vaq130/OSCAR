summary: Source code

description: |
  Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel. 
  Code repositories are often accessible via an API (ex: https://api.github.com, https://gitlab.com/api). Access to these APIs are often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level of protection.
  Exfiltration to a code repository can also provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if it is a popular service already used by hosts within the network.
