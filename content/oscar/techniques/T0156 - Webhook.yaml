summary: Webhook

description: |
  A Webhook attack is a technique used by threat actors to gain unauthorized access to a target's web application and exfiltrate data from it. 
  In this type of attack, the attacker gains access to the victim's web application and installs a malicious webhook, which is a piece of code that is executed whenever a specific event occurs on the web application.
  The webhook is designed to exfiltrate data from the victim's web application and transmit it to a remote server controlled by the attacker. 
  The data exfiltrated can include sensitive information such as user credentials, customer data, or financial information.
  Webhook attacks can be used to bypass outbound traffic control because the exfiltrated data is transmitted through legitimate channels that are often used by the web application. 
  This makes it difficult for traditional network security tools to detect the exfiltration of data.
