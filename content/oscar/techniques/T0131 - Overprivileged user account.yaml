  The overprivileged user account attack is a technique of lateral movement tactic in which an attacker gains access to a user account with excessive privileges and uses that account to move laterally within a network, accessing resources and systems that they are not authorized to access.
  It may affects Cloud, CI/CD accounts, an attacker can potentially manipulate the CI/CD pipeline or Cloud configuration to introduce malicious code into the software build or deployment process. 
  This could lead to the deployment of compromised software, which can result in data breaches, malware infections, or other security incidents.
