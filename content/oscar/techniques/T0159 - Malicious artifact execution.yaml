summary: Malicious artifact execution

description: |
  Malicious artifact execution refers to an attack where an attacker injects or modifies a software component with malicious code that is executed when the component is used by a downstream system in the CI/CD process. 
  When a CI/CD process lacks sufficient mechanisms to validate the integrity of code and artifacts, attackers can insert malicious code that appears to be harmless. 
  This allows the malicious code to pass through the pipeline undetected, potentially causing harm in the CI/CD process or in production.
  The malicious code can be executed in the CI/CD process or even in production.
